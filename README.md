### epanetCPA: An EPANET-based Matlab wrapper to simulate Cyber Physical Attacks on water distribution systems

The repository is still under maintenance, although the code in the epanetCPA folder is already working.

In order to use the toolbox, please download and compile epanet2 (https://www.epa.gov/water-research/epanet) and put epanet2.h, epanet2.lib and epanet2.dll in your local epanetCPA folder.
